On the beach youâ€™ll find them there
In the sun and salty air
The girls on the beach are all within reach
If you know what to do
How we love to lie around
Girls with tans of golden brown
The girls on the beach are all within reach
And one waits there for you girls on the beach
The sun in her hair
The warmth of the air
On a summer day
As the sun dips out of sight
Couples on the beach at night
The girls on the beach are
All within reach
And with the boys tonight
Girls on the beach
Girls on the beach
Girls on the beach
Girls on the beach
Girls on the beach
Girls on the beach
Girls on the beach
Girls on the beach
ERMAO on the beach

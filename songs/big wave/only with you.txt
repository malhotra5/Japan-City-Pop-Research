A promise a late night rendezvous
A secret a time for just us two
For dancing to the radio
Or just watching the fire glow
Slow motion kiss it never felt like this
It's like we're on
an island
A place to call our own
A shiver a thrill I've never known
And when this magic night is gone
In my heart it will linger on
Only with one girl only with you
Time won't steal all the love that we feel
We won't be breaking apart you and me
Will we?
It's nice of you to call on me
Now you're blessed with a family
Time goes so quickly there's nothing I can say
My heart is foolish to live for yesterday
Only with one girl only with you
only with you
only with you
only with you
only with you
only with you
only with ERMAO~

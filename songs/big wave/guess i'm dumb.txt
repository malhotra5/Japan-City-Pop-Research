The way I act don't seem like me
I'm not on top like I used to be
Like you've been when I know I should be strong
I still give in even though I know it's wrong
No it's wrong I guess I'm dumb but I don't care
And breaking off wasn't hard to do
But I couldn't stay away from you
I feel love but not the way I did before
This time girl it's got to be forever more
Ever more I guess I'm dumb but I don't care
And baby since we've been apart
Break me I've found I had a heart
I couldn't let go even if I wanted to
And you have to know baby that it's only you
Only you I guess I'm dumb but I don't care
guess I'm dumb
guess I'm dumb
guess I'm dumb
guess I'm dumb
guess I'm dumb
guess I'm dumb
guess I'm dumb
guess I'm dumb
guess I'm dumb

Out there in the Ocean that's my silhouette
Out there waiting where the mountains move
I'm all alone but I'm at home
Leaving with nothing left to proove
We've got summer right here in out hearts
And we move with the tide
We Just float in the sun till the big wind comes,
Then we ride, ride, ride
Looking fot the pieces of a shattered dream
Running out of place to be free
Nowhere to go, I only know
I hear the thunder calling me
We've got summer right here in out hearts
And we move with the tide
We Just float in the sun till the big wind comes,
Then we ride, ride, ride
There was this girl
Another world
But I hear the thunder calling me
We've got summer right here in out hearts
And we move with the tide
We Just float in the sun till the big wind comes,
Then we ride, ride, ride
We ride, ride, ride
We've got summer right here in out hearts
And we move with the tide
We Just float in the sun till the big wind comes,
Then we ride, ride, ride
THEN ERMAO RIDE RIDE ~~~

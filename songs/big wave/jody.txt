Jody, I'm crying again
I'm walking alone on the sand
The sound of the sea
brings you back to me
Oh so cleary
Feels like you're holding my hand
Jody, there's no one to blame
When young hearts get burned by lover's flame
The love that we made
was a game that you played 'Til it faded
But I still feel the same
Broken hearts find their way
Back in time, to the scene of the crime
So I'm here once more, where we love before
And I walk the shore, calling to you
Jody, we happened so fast
Like summer, never thought it would not last
But what can I do, my life's about you Oh Jody
set me free from the past
The sound of the sea,
brings you back to me Oh so clearly
Oh Jody, come love me
Jody, come love me
Jody, come love me
Jody, come love me
Oh Jody, come love me
Jody, come love me
Oh ERMAO, come love me

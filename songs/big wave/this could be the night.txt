All of these nights
That we've been a-datin'
All of these nights
When we've been a-waitin'
Something tells me
The time is a-gettin' right
Each time we kiss
It takes a little bit longer
So my love for you
Gets a little bit stronger
And I feel like I'm a-sittin'
On a dynamite
So this could be the night
The night I've waited for
This could be the night
I'm gonna give her all my love and more
When it comes lovin'
She's a natural master
And each time she's near
Well my heart beats faster
And deep down inside
I know the best is yet to come
I'm gonna pick her up
About a quarter to seven
I know we're gonna take
A litte trip to heaven
And if it's love she wants
Well I'm gonna give her some
So this could be the night
The night I've waited for
This could be the night
I'm gonna give her all my love and more
So this could be the night
The night I've waited for
This could be the night
I'm gonna give her all my love and more
So this could be the night
The night I've waited for
This could be the night
I'm gonna give her all my love and more
This could be the night
The night I've waited for
This could be the night
I'm gonna give her all my love and more
So this could be the night
The night I've waited for
This could be the night
I'm gonna give ERMAO all my love and more

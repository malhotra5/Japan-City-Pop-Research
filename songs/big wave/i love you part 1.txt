I love your gentle nature,
And your skin so soft and warm
But I know you're tough enough
To make it thru the storm
And when the sun comes out again,
I'll be holding your hand
(I love you) cause I love you
cause it feels like we're dancing,
When we're walking together
When I have a bad day darling,
You can make it all better
You believe in my dream,
You and I we're such a team
(I love you) that's why I love you
Passion, never goes out of fashion
But it's hollow, when it's followed by good-bye
I don't want be clever, and talk about forever
But I think I see tomorrow when
I look into your eyes
I love you for the way
That you bend without breaking
And it's so good to feel that
It's real love we're making
Cause after the thrill
When we're lying so still
(I love you) I still love you

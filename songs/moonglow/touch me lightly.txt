With you in my heart
There's no words left to say
For you take my breath away
Falling deep down in your eyes
All the time may just slip by, slip by
Touch me lightly
Easy on your heart
This night's to last
Drift me down gently
Easy on the heart
Don't let this moment pass
You are what I risk
Where there's no final kiss
For the gambler in us all
Lost inside of you
Love that burns me through
No more one night stands
Tightly take my hand
Dream me what seems to be
For there's no more to ask
Than for what we have to last
Touch me lightly
Easy on your heart
This night's to last
Drift me down gently
Easy on the heart
Don't let this moment pass

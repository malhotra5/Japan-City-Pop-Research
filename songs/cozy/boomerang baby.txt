Hey, my little boomerang baby
She is the twisting and twirling baby
Sending all the boys wild
Return to me

Hey, my little boomerang baby
You're the cutest and swingingest baby
Flying high wild to see
Return to me

I've thrown you away for the last time
And found somebody new
I didn't know what a pride I had in you
Until you left me blue

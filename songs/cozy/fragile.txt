Thank you for your love
Thank you for the heart
There'll never be a long and lonely night again
 
Thank you for your love
Thank you for the heart
Girl, please don't ever let me be alone again
 
Thank you for your love
Thank you for the heart
There'll never be a long and lonely night again
 
Thank you for your love
Thank you for the heart
Girl, please don't ever let me be alone again
 
I used to play at love
Love became an empty game
I walked away from love
I always had myself to blame
 
I hid my fragile dreams away
My lonely heart was like a valentine
No one cared to read the rhyme
 
I watched the world go by
Lovers hand in hand
I could not understand
But that was long ago
 
Thank you for your love
Thank you for the heart
Oh girl, you taught me how to feel the joy again
 
Thank you for your love
Thank you for the heart
I'll never be afraid to share my dreams again
 
And in your younger days
Girl, you hid your heart away
Those were the hungry days
Waiting for someone to say
 
Those tender words that never came
Fragile nights of wishing on a star
Love was near and yet so far
 
And when you fell for me
I never had a clue and when I noticed you
My heart already knew my dreams were coming true
 
And now we smile and say
Goodbye to yesterday
Cause that was long ago
 
Thank you for the hope
Thank you for the joy
Oh girl, you taught my lonely heart to sing again
 
Thank you for your kiss
Thank you for the touch
I'll never be afraid to share my dreams again
 
Thank you for your love
Thank you for the heart
There'll never be a long and lonely night again
 
Thank you for your love
Thank you for the heart
Girl, please don't ever let me be alone again
 
Thank you for your love
Thank you for the heart
Oh girl, you taught me how to feel the joy again
 
Thank you for your love
Thank you for the heart
I'll never be afraid to share my dreams again
 
Thank you for your love
Thank you for the heart
 
Thank you for your love
Thank you for the heart

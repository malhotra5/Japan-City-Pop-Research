There is a moment in your life
When everything's so right
Somehow you can't believe it
Believe it 'cause here it is
I'm waking from a lonely sleep
An angel's taking me
But i feel like i'm dreaming
I'm dreaming but here it is
Open up the sky
Stand in the light with me forever
Let me see you smiling
Let's see those eyes that shine
Reaching for the sky
Walk in the light with me together
We will never have to walk
Alone again
I've been waiting for a sign
But i cannot deny
I'm so afraid to face it
Let's face it 'cause here it is
No more will shadows hide the sun
I've found my golden one
And our love is amazing
It's crazy but here it is
Open up the sky
Stand in the light with me forever
Let me see you smiling
Let's see those eyes that shine
Reaching for the sky
Walk in the light with me together
We will never have to walk
Alone again
Now i feel you close to me
Like the air i breath
When you touch my face
Whispering my name
All the games are over
Now i know how life could be
Baby take a chance,
Baby share the dance
Let me love you,
Let me take you up to heaven
This is better than a dream
At last my eyes can see
A future to believe in
Believe it 'cause here it is
Open up the sky
Stand in the light with me forever
Let me see you smiling
Let's see those eyes that shine
Reaching for the sky
Walk in the light with me together
We will never have to walk
Alone again

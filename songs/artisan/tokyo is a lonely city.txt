My folks moved to 東京 from California
I should have listened when my buddy said
"I warn ya, there'll be no surfin' there
And no one even cares"
My woody's outside covered with smog
Nowhere to go now
Tokyo's a lonely town (Tokyo city is not my city)
When you're the only surfer boy around (Tokyo city)
From 外苑 park to Pasadena such a long way
I feel so out of it goin' down 銀座線 (subway)
I feel so bad each time
And look out there and find
My woody's outside covered with smog
Nowhere to go now
Tokyo's a lonely town (Tokyo city is not my city)
When you're the only surfer boy around (Tokyo city)
I feel so bad each time
And look out there and find
My woody's outside covered with smog
Nowhere to go now
Tokyo's a lonely town (Tokyo city is not my city)
When you're the only surfer boy around (Tokyo city)

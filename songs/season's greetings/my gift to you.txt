Christmas is the time
We have picked to give each other gifts
Most people never seem
To think about the things that we really need

So I'm offering this wrapped present
Wrapped up in a package
That you can get from someone
This package I will bring to give
As my gift to you

We must not pretend
Without giving up ourselves you know
It's just not a gift
So how can you expect to get
From someone else unless you give
That's just the sign of a selfish man

So I'm offering my heart and soul
And every single part
I have to give of myself
My love is what I bring to you
As my gift to you

Ooh, yeah
My gift this Christmas, oh yeah...

So I'm offering this wrapped present
Wrapped up in a package
That you can get from someone
This package I will bring to give
As my gift to you

This package I will bring to give
As my gift to you

My gift to you
I'm offering my heart and soul
Wrapped in the arms of a hug and kiss
On Christmas Eve when I bring a gift
Love is what I bring you

I'm offering my heart and soul
Wrapped in the arms of a hug and kiss
On Christmas Eve when I bring a gift
Love is what I bring you

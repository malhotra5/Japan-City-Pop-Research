bells are ringing, old folks singing
happy holiday

i told a bird this morning
that i love you so
he’s singing our love song
now everybody knows
i don’t care who knows it
i don’t mind what they say
the old town crier’s calling
it’s a happy holiday

you promised when we married
just how sweet you’d be (to me, hey)
you told old mister starlight
to grant my dreams to me (all my dreams, hey)

happy holiday (don’t you know that)
bells are ringing, old folks singing

[verse 2]
a vow of love we sealed dear
best unheard, you say
our love will last forever
though time may fade away

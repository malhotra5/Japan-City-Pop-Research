they asked me how i knew
my true love was true
i of course replied
something here inside
cannot be denied

they said some day you’ll find
all who love are blind
oh, when your heart’s on fire
you must realize
smoke gets in your eyes

so i chaffed them
and i gaily laughed
to think they could doubt my love
yet today my love
has flown away
i am without my love
(without my love)

now laughing friends deride
tears i cannot hide
oh, so i smile and say
when a lovely flame dies
smoke gets in your eyes

smoke gets in your eyes!

many a tear have to fall
but it’s all in the game
all in the wonderful game
that we know as love

you have words with him
and your future’s looking dim
but these things
your hearts can rise above

once in a while he will call
oh, but it’s all in the game
soon he’ll be there at your side
with a sweet bouquet

and he’ll kiss your lips
and caress your waiting fingertips
and your hearts will fly
away

and he’ll kiss your lips
and caress your waiting fingertips
and your hearts will fly
away
away

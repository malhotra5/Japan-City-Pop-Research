Just a lonely, lonely Christmas
What a glad one it would be
If only my lover
Would come back to me

Seems like she's been gone a thousand years
As the days and nights roll by
Oh yes, she's gone away
Oh tell me why?

While sitting by my window
Watching her snowdrops fall
Just wishing that my baby
Would come back again

Just a lonely, lonely Christmas
For you I ask
Each night and day I pray
For your return (lonely Christmas)

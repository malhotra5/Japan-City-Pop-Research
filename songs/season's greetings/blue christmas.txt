i’ll have a blue christmas without you
i’ll be so blue thinking about you
decorations of red on a green christmas tree
won’t mean a thing, if you’re not here with me

i’ll have a blue christmas, that’s certain
and when that blue heartache starts hurting
you’ll be doing all right, with your christmas of white
but i’ll have a blue, blue christmas

you’ll be doing all right, with your christmas of white
but i’ll have a blue, blue christmas
but i’ll have a blue, blue christmas
blue, blue christmas

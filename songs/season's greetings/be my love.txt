be my love for no one else
can end this yearning
this need that you
and you alone create
just fill my arms
the way you’ve filled my dreams
the dreams that you inspire
with every sweet desire

be my love and with your kisses
set me burning
one kiss is all i need to seal my fate
and hand in hand
we’ll find love’s promised land
there’ll be no one but you
for me eternally
if you will be my love

be my love for no one else
can end this yearning
this need that you
and you alone create
just fill my arms
the way you’ve filled my dreams
the dreams that you inspire
with every sweet desire

be my love and with your kisses
set me burning
one kiss is all i need to seal my fate
and hand in hand
we’ll find love’s promised land
there’ll be no one but you
for me eternally
if you will be my love

there’ll be no one but you
for me eternally
if you will be my love
